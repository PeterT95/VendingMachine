About
==========================

	This repository contains a solution for to the Oracle Vending Machine Coding challenge.
	
	The codebase was implemented in Java 1.8 using the Eclipse IDE. It is recommended to import  
	these projects into Eclipse.

	You work for a firm which produces vending machines, currently for the UK market, and you are
	responsible for a new software component that tracks change (as in coins) within the vending
	machines.
	
	This component needs to provide APIs which:
	
	>  Initialise the vending machine to a known state, for use when the machine is set up. This
	should include setting the initial float (the coins placed in the machine for customer change)
	which should be accepted as a parameter.
	
	> Register coins that have been deposited by a user.
	
	> Produce a collection of coins that sum to a particular value (accepted as a parameter) from
	the coins available in the machine (for the purpose of returning change to the user) and
	remove the coins from the machine.

Design considerations :


1) GBP Coins 




2) Vending Machine

	floats in imprecise so need to use math.round to remove imprecision
	
	considerations surrounding how to distribute
